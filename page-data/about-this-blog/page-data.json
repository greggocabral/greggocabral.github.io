This way I expect them to come out more fluent and easier to understand whenever I refer to them in the future.</p>\n<p>I could write all these and keep it in private, but I decided to expose it to the world to connect with likeminded people. Also, it’s a way to communicate concisely with people I already know, so that they can see what I do, how I do it and, hopefully, why I do it.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About this blog","date":"August 11, 2019","translations":null,"category":"Blog","sub_category":"About"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about-this-blog/","language":"en","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/project-sentate/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sentate"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About me"}}}}}
