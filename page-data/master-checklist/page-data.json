I decided how much time I would spend doing each of the activities. I <a href=\"/quantifying-life\">divided the day into 48 blocks</a> of 25 minutes with 5 minute break in between. Then, I assigned  a certain amount of blocks (or fractions of them) to each activity. [read about quantifying life]</p>\n<p>There are items from the list, like fasting hours, that are not activities but behaviors. For those I assigned zero blocks, but should be quantified somehow in the future.</p>\n<p>Later, I grouped the activities by type, just to make sure I took care of all the <a href=\"/fat-success\">global aspects I care about</a> everyday. I also classified activities as <a href=\"/cumulative-or-maintenance\">maintenance or cumulative</a>, to easily get a sense of the impact of the activity.</p>\n<p>Finally, I put them into a Google Sheet and converted it into a checklist.</p>\n<h2>The results so far</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using this system every weekday for one month now. I am getting to do about 90% of the blocks and enjoy the repeated state of satisfaction at the end of the day that this is bringing to me.</p>\n<p>By going through the checklist a few times every workday and acting on it, I feel I am doing everything that is required to stay healthy, social and in continuous personal and professional growth, while still having around enough “free” hours a workday to do whatever else I want.</p>\n<p>The master checklist is functional and reliable enough for it to be useful but there is of course a lot of room for improvement. I incorporated daily “meta-blocks”, allocated to review the daily progress that far and improve the system when needed.</p>\n<p>Apart from regular tunings like adding/removing activities and adjusting durations, the main improvements I’m considering are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a scoring system for zero block items and activity prioritization</li>\n<li>better accounting for activities in the times-per-week and times-per-month frequencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope in the future I can end up with a system that guarantees the growth and balance I mentioned before, keeps itself under continuous improvement and stays out of the way.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I might also end up finding this too demanding/unnecessary/insane. In that case I will abandon,  hopefully after expressing my reasons for doing so. Nevertheless, I don’t feel I will regret testing it for another month and using some undeniable benefits while doing so.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here I am, earning a tick on my daily blogging block.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Write me at greggocabral@gmail.com to get invited to access the Master Checkist file</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Master Checklist","date":"August 25, 2019","translations":null,"category":"Blog","sub_category":"Systems for life"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/master-checklist/","language":"en","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-me/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About me"}},"next":null}}}
