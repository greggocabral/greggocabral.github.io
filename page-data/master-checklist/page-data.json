These are activities that I tested for a while and found that are effective for boosting my health, mental state and productivity.</p>\n<p>In the past years though, I realized that the length of the list seems to be converging to a value, while I keep consuming the same resources that usually generated items for the list. This is how I decided that I’ve done enough research and that it is time to focus on implementing the practices for a longer term and not for the short tests I’ve been doing.</p>\n<p>However, I keep wondering how could it be possible for me to incorporate all these activities into everyday life, coordinate them so that they can all coexist and keep them going there for the time they require to actually produce the real claimed benefits.</p>\n<p>So, for example, I would often question myself, how could I make sure everyday I:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sleep enough</li>\n<li>workout</li>\n<li>drink enough water</li>\n<li>floss</li>\n<li>have medical checks</li>\n<li>journal</li>\n<li>get enough deep work hours</li>\n<li>take online courses</li>\n<li>finish side projects</li>\n<li><a href=\"/about-this-blog\">blog</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/deliverate-practice\">read, learn and memorize stuff</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/quantifying-life\">stay close to family and friends</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am now in the quest to find a system that would help me track all these so that I can trust the process and relax.</p>\n<h2>The proposed solution</h2>\n<p>The solution I am currently trying out is a master checklist.</p>\n<p>I first wrote down a list with everything that I was already happily doing everyday and then added everything else that I’ve been wanting to incorporate into my routine.</p>\n<p>After that, Ii did what I consider the most valuable part of the system: quantifying the dedication to each activity. I decided how much time I would spend doing each of the activities. I <a href=\"/quantifying-life\">divided the day into 48 blocks</a> of 25 minutes with 5 minute breaks in between. Then, I assigned  a certain amount of blocks (or fractions of them) to each activity.</p>\n<p>There are items from the list, like <a href=\"/intermitent-fasting\">fasting hours</a>, that are not activities but behaviors. For those I assigned zero blocks, but should be quantified somehow in the future.</p>\n<p>Later, I grouped the activities by type, just to make sure I worked on all <a href=\"/success-and-fat\">things I care about</a> everyday. I also classified activities as <a href=\"/cumulative-or-maintenance\">maintenance or cumulative</a>, to easily get a sense of the impact of the activity.</p>\n<p>Finally, I put them into a Google Sheet and converted it into a checklist.</p>\n<h2>The results so far</h2>\n<p>I’ve been using this system every weekday for a month now. I am getting to do about 90% of the listed activities and enjoy the repeated state of satisfaction at the end of the day that this is bringing to me.</p>\n<p>By going through the checklist a few times every workday and acting on it, I feel I am doing everything that is required to stay healthy, social and in continuous personal and professional growth, while still having a few extra hours to do whatever else I want.</p>\n<p>The master checklist is functional and reliable enough but there is of course a lot of room for improvement. I incorporated daily “meta-blocks”, allocated to review the daily progress that far and improve the system when needed.</p>\n<p>Apart from regular tunings like adding/removing activities and adjusting durations, the main improvements I’m considering are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a scoring system for zero block items and activity prioritization</li>\n<li>better accounting for activities in the times-per-week and times-per-month frequencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope in the future I can end up with a system that guarantees the growth and balance I mentioned before, keeps itself under continuous improvement and stays out of the way.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I might also end up finding this to be too demanding/unnecessary/insane. In that case I will abandon, hopefully after expressing my reasons for doing so. In any case, I don’t feel I will regret testing it and using some undeniable benefits while doing so.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, here I am, earning a tick on my daily blogging block.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Email me at greggocabral@gmail.com if you want access to the master checklist Google Sheet</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Master Checklist","date":"August 28, 2019","translations":null,"category":"Blog","sub_category":"Systems for life"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/master-checklist/","language":"en","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about-this-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About this blog"}},"next":null}}}
